## how to use (script)

make sure you have a Tab for a Cause account,
specifically one that uses the "Email address" sign up option
(it's strongly recommended you DO NOT use your main account if you have one,
instead make an alt account on Tab for a Cause to use for this script if this is the case)

in the same directory as the `tab-for-a-cause-selenium.py` script,
make a `credentials.txt` file and put the account's credentials in it like the following

```txt
youremail
yourpassword
```

run the `tab-for-a-cause-selenium.py` script and let it run in the background

## requirements (script)

- python 3

- selenium

- firefox
